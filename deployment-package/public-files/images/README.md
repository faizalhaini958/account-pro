# Dashboard Screenshots Setup

To complete the landing page setup, you need to add your dashboard screenshots for light and dark mode.

## Steps:

1. Take screenshots of your dashboard in both light and dark mode
2. Save them with the following names in `public/images/`:
   - `dashboard-light.png` - Screenshot of dashboard in light mode
   - `dashboard-dark.png` - Screenshot of dashboard in dark mode

## Recommended Screenshot Settings:

- Resolution: 1200x800 pixels or higher
- Format: PNG or WebP
- Quality: High (for crisp display)

## Current Implementation:

The landing page is set up to automatically switch between light and dark dashboard images based on the user's theme preference. The images will display with a nice shadow and border effect.

You can replace the placeholder API calls in `Home.tsx` with the actual image paths once you've added your screenshots.
